Life drawing, (or drawing naked people) is a prescribed regular exercise for all artists. As an aspiring classical animator, at the time I felt I really needed this exercise as well. A thorough search for existing classes I could join turned up with nothing. So the only option left was to start my own lifedrawing class.
The truth is after I got it off the ground I realised it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. It was a great experience in building something ground up, running it and letting it go at the right time so it could evolve.

Here's how I got started.



      <br />

      </br />


 Step 1 Building with empathy and transparency to earn credibility

At its core, I wanted this class to offer
- A safe open space for artists of all levels to draw without judgement.
- A fair compensation for the models gracious enough to pose for us.
- A great drawing experience for the artists, trusting us.


2. Building trust, transparency and credibility

For almost all the models I employed, posing for lifedrawing was the first time they were doing it.
I felt it was really important to me to make sure that they were always comfortable.
I did this by ensuring that they were completely aware of the challenges of posing for a life drawing group.
and were always comfortable. I also made sure, that the expected nude posing was optional in my class. Depending on the models comfort level they could chowose how they would prefer to pose.

Most importantly I made sure I also made sure they were always fairly compensated,
The first pricing model I had was a fixed amount, and a variable amount.
So for any session the model would get paid a certain amount for sure. But after a certain number of artists, the model would get more money per artist. This meant, the model was incentivised to pose for us even when the crowds were low.
And it worked. We got some really good regular models who were renumerated pretty well for their efforts.

For the artists, I wanted to make sure the models were proffesional. So before bringing a model to a wider class, I would do a one hour session, paid with new models. This would help me understand how they would perform as models, and if they themeselves were comfortable with posing.

The overall results was a proffesionally run life drawing session, with great models and great artists.
