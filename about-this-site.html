        How I finally built my own website

      <p>
        <span class=firstpara>Honestly, skill wise I'd been ready to build my own website <strong>months before </strong>I actually built it.
          But I kept sabotaging myself by looking at the portfolio sites of other designers.
          The rationale was to collect inspiration and ideas I could implement here, in this site. In reality, the effect was completely the opposite.
          Instead of inspired, I would be left with crippling inferiority complex and the anxiety that followed.</span><br /></br />
        I was adamant that I wanted to build this site from scratch by my own hand. There were some amazing patterns and trends that design portfolios were using,
        and, I wanted to have those in my site too (or so I thought). However I was limited by programming ability and would definitely need pro developer help,
        if I wanted to put those patterns in here.
        Comparison is the death of joy Mark Twain said. And comparing my yet-to-be-built website to those fantastic portfolio sites,
        I quickly accepted that I was not yet ready and chose to park the project.<br />
        </br />


        The much needed epiphany struck not once but twice, a few months later. First when I visited <a href="https://www.nashvail.me/" target="_blank">Nishant Verma's site</a>,
        and second during a <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/p/the-complete-web-development-course target=" _blank"">udemy course</a> I was taking.
        In a particular module students had to build their own websites based on the websites of some serious computer science giants.
        Namely <a href="https://www.nashvail.me/" target="_blank">Thomas Cormen</a> and <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/" target="_blank">Donal Knuth</a>.

        At that moment I realised, in building my own site I had fallen into the classic conundrum of<strong> treating my website
          as a visual artefact rather than a simple, impactful design outcome to a problem</strong>.
        All the thought leaders, designers and products that I admire ardently followed this philosophy of simplicity, impact and outcome.
        And by comparing myself to the trends, I had strayed from the path.
        (I also went back to this gem, the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank">Motherf*cking website.</a>)
      </p>


      <h5 style="margin-top:60px;font-weight:900;">
        Building a solution and not a parallax scroll
      </h5>


      Energy level restored, I was back to the drawing board. This time, I asked myself what was the problem I was trying to solve.<br />

      <ul>
        <li>I needed a website.</li>
        <li>It needed to be a representation of my worldview and design/ life philosophy.</li>
        <li>It needed to showcase my portfolio and my writing.</li>
        <li>It needed to be simple enough that I could maintain and add to, without the need to harass my developer friends.</li>
        <li>It needed to be light and viewable on any device.</li>
        <li><strong>I should learn something incremental and have fun building it.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      Reviewing the checklist above I realised two things. First, all the skills I needed to build this site, I had already.
      Second, I should ask my wife to punch me in the face for ignoring the obvious.
      <div class="articleimages">

      </div>

      With the purpose of why I was building this site clear in my mind <strong>, it took me a total of two days to complete the build.</strong>
      Starting with loose designs in Sketch, I translated the design to HTML CSS and added a dash of Bootstrap for the responsive grids.
      The responsiveness though, is majorly hand coded, just because I was having fun writing media queries.
      <strong>And this time, because I was solely focussed on an outcome and a solution, completely
        ignoring what was trendy, and not comparing myself to anything else, I found my joy and enthusiasm sustained.</strong>
      In fact they grew with each line of code I wrote and with each refresh of the browser to see the HTML CSS come alive.
      Following another simple tutorial I hosted everything onto gitpages, and linked the static site to my custom domain.
      And it was done!

      By no means is it perfect. Butâ€¦

        Moving forward
      </h5>
      So now the site's up. And I believe it accomplishes what I set out to do. But there is work to be done.
      On the roadmap are

      <ul>
        <li>
          Optimising the design for accessibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting up a blogging platform. (Hugo or Jekyll, need to take a call)
        </li>
        <li>
          Moving important portfolio pieces to the site itself, rather than behance.
        </li>
      </ul>
