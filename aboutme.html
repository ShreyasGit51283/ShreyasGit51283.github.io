    <h4 class="black">
      Hello! I have bachelor’s degree in Microbiology.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I actually do. Which was followed by a Master’s in Anthropology. I am also from Goa.
      I was reading comic books before nerd culture was cool, and was working in startups when startups
      were broke and for the career pariahas. I’ve since worked in,
      and experienced most of the creative industry, from animation studios to big name corporates.
      As a self taught designer I am not a big fan of labels. I just want to make sure I
      have whatever skills it takes to get the job done, and done well. I am an avid fan of
      horror films and Doctor Who. I am also heavily influenced by the philosophies of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/C-H-speech.html">Bill
        Watterson</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work?language=en">Jason Fried</a>. I yearn for a simple life well lived, that lets me be available for the people
      I care about.
    </p>

    <h5 style="margin-top:30px;">Bonus Fact</h5>
    <p>
      I also started one of Bangalore's first <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lifedrawingbangalore/?hl=en" target="_blank">life drawing groups</a>. It’s now handled by two amazing artists.
